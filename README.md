# meowfetch
custom neofetch with animations (and when i named it i did not know that there is already a reposetory with that name)
<br>
in beta
<br>
well more then neofetch with animations it is a ASCII-Art animator in the therminal
<br>
<p>to use it as package, just download meowfetch.deb and in the same direktory open a terminal and type:</p>
<p>sudo apt install meowfetch.deb</p>
<p>after that you have to create an direktory in ~/.config calld meowfetch with the lua script and the animation direktory in the repo</p>
<br>
<p>its just for debian but if you want just create the package your self</p>
<p>and sorry for the shitty code, i just learnd golang and tried some lua</p>
